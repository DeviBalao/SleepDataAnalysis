# Sleep Data Analysis Project
This repository has sections specific to questions we had wanted to ask in regards to the data we had found. How might ones job impact their sleep? How much does having a sleep disorder impact how long or how well someone has slept? How might the level of an individuals physical activity cause them to have better or worse sleep? All these questions are displayed in the files saved here in this repository with analysis alongside those displays and data provided
